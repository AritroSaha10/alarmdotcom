# Version 0.2.0

## üí° New Features

1. Alarm panel, locks, garage doors, and sensors now appear as individual devices in Home Assistant.
2. Support for opening and closing garage doors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

1. Rolled back support for thermostats. We need more information to roll out full support. Have an Alarm.com thermostat and want to help? Open a GitHub issue!

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrading from v0.1?

Your settings will be copied over to the new configuration interface automatically. Check that your settings have copied over correctly, then delete the existing alarmdotcom entry from your configuration.yaml file.

Verify that your options (including your arming code) have copied over correctly by clicking on the "Configure" button on the Alarm.com card on the Home Assistant integrations page.
